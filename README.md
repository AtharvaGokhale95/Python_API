# Python API

Flask and FastAPI are Python Web Frameworks used to build APIs.

## Drawbacks with Flask:

1. Slower than FastAPI
2. Less efficient with async programming
3. No built-in data validation
4. No automatic documentation generation

REST (Representational State Transfer) HTTP Methods:

1. GET → Retrieve Data
2. POST → Create Data
3. PUT → Update Data
4. DELETE → Remove Data

Example:

1. Get list of Users -> GET
2. Create a new User -> POST
3. Update User info -> PUT
4. Delete User -> DELETE
